# Student_Helper

This was my third year engineering Mini-Project.

In this app I have added various features that are used by engineering students as follows:

1. Basic Calculator

2. GPA to Percentage Converter

3. Percentage to GPA Converter

4. Number System Converter(from decimal to binary, octal and hexadecimal) number systems

5. Exam timetables(that were valid then)

6. Contact Database(temporary contact details insertion, updation and deletion(i.e all DML statements) using SQLite)

7. Other than that, there is a about activity with 2 activities stating features
 and details of me and my partner who made the app)
 
8. I have added background images to all these activity pages
